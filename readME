This folder includes some vibecoded apps I built following my summer internship experience on a project on vibecoding.

The summer project in itself was overall about understanding how individuals of different programming experience interact differently with a vibecoding platform on a software creation tasks of varying levels of difficulty, and what type of intereaction translates to different levels of performance.
The idea of vibecoding is to democratize software creation, i.e., making software creation accessible. However, the Question now is, would vibecoding nullify the need for experts in this space??

Today, I created an app to help me with my literature review process, thereby reducing the cognitive load I experience during this process and sort of make fun and above all SYSTEMATIC for me.

Who cold have imagined that as I am coding my research article, and I fell the need for a particular feature I need, I immediately just implement it as I go, without wasting time! Wow...This feels cool for me!!


Challenges of Vibecoding:
- App could stop working without knowing what is responsible, and a non-coder might not totally understand how to fix this.
- In my humble opinion, learning how to understand how vibecoding works is ESSENTI
